# Pathfinding-Visualisation

I created this project in python to develop my understanding of the Dijkstra and A* Algorithms. The code has been split into multiple files. The A* algorithm achieves 
true greedy but fast results, whereas the Dijkstra algorithm achieves a faster path but in longer time, as would be expected.
